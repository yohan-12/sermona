## Calorie Scam: How Food Companies Profit at the Expense of Your Metabolic Health. 

The food industry has mastered the art of "calories in, calories out."

They claim as long as you burn off calories through exercise, you're good. But let's be real, eating 100 calories of Krispy Kreme and 100 calories of an apple affects your body very differently. 

If you want to live a healthy life, you need to stop obsessing over calories and start focusing on food quality. 

### The Real Deal with Calories
A calorie is just a unit of energy. 

More precisely, it's the heat energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. But our metabolism is way more complicated than that. 

When we eat, food starts breaking down in our mouth and continues in the small intestine, where it's absorbed into our bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, these molecules are transported into our cells where mitochondria will start producing ATP. 

As you can imagine, calories do not explain any of the fundamental dynamic of how we actually produce energy. For instance, when you eat 100 calories of Krispy Kreme donut, the refined carbohydrates will quickly dissolve into simple glucose, triggering glucose spike in our blood. Pancreas will release insulin to enable glucose to enter our cells. This glucose spike is what ultimately causes insulin resistance, which leads to a host of other metabolic complications. 

On the contrary, eating 100 calories of an apple has the exact opposite effect. Fiber in apple acts as a barrier to slow down the absorption of glucose, which result in a stable glucose levels. Additionally, apple contains various anti-oxidants that protect our body from free radicals. The total ATP produced may depend on the amount of glucose present in both the donut and an apple; however, the metabolic impact is day and night.

So, if you want to find how much heat energy a food has, by all means, use calories. But if your goal is to sleep well, avoid afternoon crash and live a happier life, focus on the actual ingredient. 

### Food Companies Main Incentive: Profit
Just like any business, food industry's primary goal is to make money.

What this essentially means is that they are going to use the cheapest edible substances to hook customers into their ultra-processed food. Almost always, these highly processed chemicals don't promote the well-being of humankind. This is very disturbing because most of the chronic illnesses, like diabetes, and kidney diseases, stem from what we consume on a daily basis, spanning multiple years. 

Take Doritos, for example. They are essentially corn paste like mixture made from mixing highly processed corn flour with seed oils and maltodextrin. These seeds oil are the unhealthy fats that are triggering systematic inflammation throughout our body, and maltodextrin and flour are practically sugar, causing glucose spike. Additionally, they add MSG to make this junk food literally taste delicious. Constant exposure to this intense flavors can fuel unhealthy eating habits, such as binge eating. Studies on ultra-processed food clearly show that it not only causes metabolic problems but also contribute to mental and societal complication.
